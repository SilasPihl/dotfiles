# Agent Alignment Report

## Summary
All agents have been updated and aligned with the following improvements:

### Completed Updates

1. **Model References**
   - Kept all agents using `model: sonnet` (original configuration)
   - This appears to be the correct shorthand for agent configurations

2. **MCP Tool Integration**
   - Added Playwright MCP references to all agents
   - Added Ref MCP references for documentation search capabilities
   - Provided specific guidance on when to use each MCP tool

3. **Agent Portfolio Consistency**
   - Updated agent-manager to include all 6 active agents (including design-review)
   - Ensured all agents reference the complete set of peer agents
   - Maintained consistent cross-agent references

### Key Improvements Made

#### 1. **Playwright MCP Integration**
- All agents now aware of `mcp__playwright__*` tools
- Frontend-developer: Uses for visual validation and UI testing
- Design-review: Primary tool for comprehensive design validation
- Other agents: Available for testing integrations and validating UI impacts

#### 2. **Ref MCP Documentation Search**
- All agents now aware of `mcp__Ref__*` tools
- Backend-developer: Search Go libraries, NATS patterns, PostgreSQL best practices
- Frontend-developer: Search React, Next.js, and shadcn/ui patterns
- N8n-workflow-designer: Search integration patterns and workflow best practices
- Design-planner: Search architectural patterns and design guidelines

#### 3. **Cross-Agent Communication**
- All agents maintain consistent reference to design-planner as mandatory first step
- Clear agent coordination sections in each agent file
- Performance reporting back to agent-manager standardized

### Remaining Opportunities

1. **Enhanced Communication Protocols**
   - Consider adding specific data formats for agent handoffs
   - Define clearer escalation paths for conflicts
   - Create standardized reporting formats

2. **Tool Specification Consistency**
   - Design-review has explicit tool list while others don't
   - Consider standardizing approach across all agents

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - Could add specific KPIs for each agent type
   - Standardize performance reporting format

## Agent Roles Summary

1. **agent-manager** (Gold): Central orchestration and optimization
2. **backend-developer** (Blue): Go microservices and PostgreSQL
3. **design-planner** (Purple): Pre-implementation coordination (MANDATORY FIRST)
4. **design-review** (Pink): UI/UX validation with Playwright
5. **frontend-developer** (Purple): React/Next.js development
6. **n8n-workflow-designer** (Orange): Automation workflows
7. **tilt-monitor** (Green): Development environment coordination

All agents are now aligned with consistent model references, MCP tool awareness, and cross-agent coordination protocols.
