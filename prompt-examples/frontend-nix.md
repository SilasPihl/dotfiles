I am building the marketing website for "Lix One" — a fintech platform providing AI-driven payment rails for the agentic era. Lix One enables autonomous AI agents and businesses to manage payments, invoices, and working capital finance seamlessly. The core products are:
    •    Invoice Purchase (IP) — 100% non-recourse invoice purchasing
    •    Invoice Finance (IF) — Flexible financing with up to 90% advance rates
    •    Supply Chain Finance (SCF) — Early supplier payment with extended buyer terms
    •    Trade Credit Insurance (TC) — Receivables protection against insolvency
    •    Electronic Documents (ED) — Digital document workflow automation
    •    FX SWAP — Foreign exchange risk management

The platform serves banks, insurers, suppliers, and enterprise clients through dedicated portals, all unified under one system.

Brand identity:
    •    Color palette: Vibrant gradient from hot pink (#F72585) → purple (#7209B7) → deep blue (#3A0CA3)
    •    Dark-themed, modern, enterprise-grade aesthetic
    •    Logo: Plover bird (minimalist, elegant)
    •    Trusted partners: Allianz, Atradius, Howden
    •    Tagline: "Payment rails for the AI agentic era"

Your task is to build an incredible marketing homepage for Lix One. I want it to be creative and unique. Really push the limits of your design capabilities. The design should feel premium, trustworthy, and cutting-edge — conveying both fintech credibility and AI-forward innovation.

You have an empty directory here, I want you to initialize a project with the following specs:
    •    Next.js 15 (with Turbopack)
    •    Tailwind CSS
    •    React 19
    •    TypeScript
    •    Bun
    •    Radix UI for accessible components
    •    Motion (framer-motion) for animations

Once initialized, I want you to create FIVE different designs. Each design should be creative and unique from all the others that you create. They should be hosted on /1, /2, /3, /4 and /5 respectively.

Design direction ideas (one per page, but feel free to remix):
    1.    Hero with 3D Spline animation, interactive payment flow visualization, feature cards with gradient badges per product
    2.    Brutalist/bold typography-driven design with oversized numbers, animated counters, and a live transaction feed mockup
    3.    Bento grid layout with micro-interactions, glassmorphism cards, and an interactive world map showing payment corridors
    4.    Cinematic full-screen sections with parallax scrolling, video backgrounds, and a timeline showing how a payment moves through the system
    5.    Minimal Swiss-design inspired layout with precise grid, monospace accents, and an interactive product comparison matrix

Use your frontend design skill to make these designs exceptional.

Use the following port for the dev server: 4000.
