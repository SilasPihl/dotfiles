## Instructions

Build FIVE design variations of the feature described above. All five must:

-   Ensure to use the existing tailwindcss theme from packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css variables, theme from `@repo/ui` — no hardcoded colors or custom theming.
-   Reuse existing components from `@repo/ui` wherever possible. Only create new components if nothing suitable exists, and if you do, prefer to make them generic enough to add to `@repo/ui`.
-   Share the same functionality and content — the differences are in layout, visual hierarchy, and interaction patterns, not in what the feature does.

Host each variation on /1 through /5.

Use your frontend design skill.
